microarchitecture pipeline, fetch and decode, and a simple load/store unit

- Implement the functional unit of a device.

- Implement the connection of the input ports to the sources of data (typically output

  latches of other devices).

- Implement the state transfer at the receipt of a clock.

要实现加法器， 移位器， logic， 乘法器， 除法器， 比较器， register file。 

Ljy :  移位器， logic， 

zhou li:  加法器， 乘法器， 除法器



创建一个抽象类, 

device, clock 改变的时候发送signal,



完成pipeline .  Stage 1 is due November 24th.

完成 simulation.   Stage 2 is due December 1st.

性能测试做simulation ,  Stage 3 and the entire project is due December 13th.





#### 评估

- nstructions per cycle (absolute performance)
- Instructions per cycle per Watt (performance relative to energy)
- Instructions per cycle per Watt per area (performance relative to cost)
